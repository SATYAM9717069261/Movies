Drowsy driving is one of the main causes of road traffic accidents. It is of great significance to design a framework to detect the drowsiness of the driver at an early stage, so as to activate drowsiness prevention mechanisms. In drowsiness detection, the main sources of information are performance measurements, physiological measurements, and behavioral measurements. We propose a hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network to model the relationship between behavioral measures and state of alertness under different illumination conditions. We validate this framework using The University of Texas at Arlington Real-Life Drowsiness Dataset (UTA-RLDD).
